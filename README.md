# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

### **Project Overview:**
A Portuguese bank faced a critical business problem: low conversion rates from its marketing campaigns aimed at promoting term deposits. Despite targeting thousands of customers, only a small percentage subscribed. This project done using **Power BI** analyzes the [Bank marketing campaign dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/bank-marketing-dataset) obtained from Kaggle.
The goal was to identify what factors contributed to successful sign-ups and which customer segments were most responsive, allowing the bank to improve the efficiency of future campaigns and increase its overall conversion rate.

### **Key Metrics:**
- **Total Customers**: 39,188
- **Total Positive Responses**: 4,415 (11.27% success rate)
- **Average Age of Customers**: 40 years
- **Average Number of Contacts**: 2.57

### **Tasks completed:**
Data ingestion, data processing/cleaning, visualizations and dashboarding.

The dashboard provides a clear view of trends across different demographic groups, making the decision-making process data-driven and actionable.

### **Key Insights:**

1. **Job-based Success Rate**:
   - The highest success rate comes from **students** (31.4%) and **retired** individuals (24.7%).
   - **Blue-collar** workers had the lowest success rate at **6.9%**.

2. **Campaign Timing**:
   - **March (49.5%)** and **December (49.1%)** recorded the highest success rates, suggesting these months are optimal for outreach.
   - The **lowest** performance was seen in **May** (6.5%) and **July** (9%).

3. **Contact Method**:
   - **Cellular contacts** had a far higher success rate (**15%**) compared to **telephone** (5%), implying a clear preference for mobile communication.
   
4. **Number of Contacts**:
   - Overall, most conversions happened with **1-3 contacts**, with diminishing returns after five or more contacts. Over-contacting seems ineffective and might even negatively affect the campaign.
   
5. **Housing Loan Holders**:
   - Customers **without housing loans** had a marginally lower success rate (10.8%) compared to those with a loan (11.7%).

6. **Educational Background**:
   - Interestingly, **illiterate** customers had a **23.5%** campaign success rate, followed by **university degree holders** at 13.7%. This suggests targeting illiterate customers may require specific messaging strategies.
   
### **Recommendations:**
- **Focus on Students and Retirees**: Since these groups show higher conversion rates, marketing materials should be more tailored to their specific needs.
  
- **Timing is Critical**: Concentrate efforts in **March** and **December** when success rates peak.
  
- **Optimize Contact Methods**: Focus more on **cellular** outreach, as it outperforms landline communication.
  
- **Refine Contact Frequency**: Limit follow-ups to no more than **3-4 contacts** to maximize efficiency while avoiding negative responses.

- **Customize messaging based on education and financial status**: Create differentiated marketing strategies for **illiterate** and **university-educated** customers, as their responses to campaigns vary significantly. Additionally, consider focusing on customers with housing loans as they may have more disposable income for investments.

--- 
With the help of this analysis, the bank can expect a higher conversion rate, reduced marketing costs, and better targeting of high-potential customers, leading to more effective and efficient marketing campaigns.
