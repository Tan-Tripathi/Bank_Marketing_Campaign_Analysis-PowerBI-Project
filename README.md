# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

### Project Overview:
A Portuguese bank faced a critical business problem: low conversion rates from its marketing campaigns aimed at promoting term deposits. Despite targeting thousands of customers, only a small percentage subscribed. This project done using **Power BI** analyzes the [Bank marketing campaign dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/bank-marketing-dataset).
The goal was to identify what factors contributed to successful sign-ups and which customer segments were most responsive, allowing the bank to improve the efficiency of future campaigns and increase its overall conversion rate.

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Customers**: 39,188
- **Total Positive Responses**: 4,415 (11.27% success rate)
- **Average Age of Customers**: 40 years
- **Average Number of Contacts**: 2.57

### Insights:

1. **Job-based Success Rate**:
   - The highest success rate comes from **students** (31.4%) and **retired** individuals (24.7%).
   - **Blue-collar** workers had the lowest success rate at **6.9%**.

2. **Campaign Timing**:
   - **May (49.9%)** and **October (49.1%)** recorded the highest success rates, suggesting these months are optimal for outreach.
   - The **lowest** performance was seen in **March** (6.5%) and **June** (9%).

3. **Contact Method**:
   - **Cellular contacts** had a far higher success rate (**15%**) compared to **telephone** (5%), implying a clear preference for mobile communication.
   
4. **Number of Contacts**:
   - Most conversions happened with **1-3 contacts**, with diminishing returns after five or more contacts. Over-contacting seems ineffective and might even negatively affect the campaign.
   
5. **Housing Loan Holders**:
   - Customers **without housing loans** had a marginally lower success rate (10.8%) compared to those with a loan (11.7%).

6. **Educational Background**:
   - Interestingly, **illiterate** customers had a **23.5%** success rate, followed by **university degree holders** at 13.7%. This suggests targeting illiterate customers may require specific messaging strategies.
   
### Recommendations:
- **Focus on Students and Retirees**: Since these groups show higher conversion rates, marketing materials should be more tailored to their specific needs.
  
- **Timing is Critical**: Concentrate efforts in **May** and **October** when success rates peak.
  
- **Optimize Contact Methods**: Focus more on **cellular** outreach, as it outperforms landline communication.
  
- **Refine Contact Frequency**: Limit follow-ups to no more than **3-4 contacts** to maximize efficiency while avoiding negative responses.

- **Educational Customization**: Create differentiated marketing strategies for **illiterate** and **university-educated** customers, as their responses to campaigns vary significantly.

By applying these insights, banks can significantly improve campaign outcomes, leading to more efficient customer acquisition strategies.
